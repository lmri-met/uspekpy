## What is USpekPy?

**USpekPy** is a Python package that allows to compute mean radiation protection quantities 
for a simulated x-ray spectrum with uncertainties using Monte Carlo techniques.
It is an open source, GPLv3-licensed library for the Python programming language.
It is compatible with Python 3, and it has been tested in Ubuntu 24.04 and Widows 10 OS.
**USpekPy** is based on the [SpekPy](https://bitbucket.org/spekpy/spekpy_release/src/master/) package, 
which is a Python software toolkit for modelling the x-ray spectra from x-ray tubes.

## Main features of USpekPy 

**USpekPy** provides three features:
- Compute **mean values of radiation protection quantities** of an x-ray spectrum simulated using SpekPy. 
  Specifically, it allows to compute the mean energy, the air kerma and the mean air kerma-to-dose-equivalent 
  conversion coefficient.
- Compute **mean radiation protection quantities** of an x-ray spectrum simulated using SpekPy 
  **with uncertainties** using Monte Carlo techniques.
  Specifically, it allows to compute the first and second half-value layer for aluminium and copper, 
  the mean energy, the air kerma and the mean air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficient.
- Perform **batch simulation** to compute the mean values and uncertainties of radiation protection quantities
  for **several x-ray spectra** simulated with SpekPy.

## How to install USpekPy?

**USpekPy** can be installed from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/uspekpy/) 
by running the following command from a terminal:

```bash
pip install uspekpy
```

## Quick user guide

### Compute mean radiation protection quantities

This first example shows how to compute the mean values of some radiation protection quantities 
of an x-ray spectrum simulated using SpekPy.
The considered x-ray spectrum is the one corresponding to the radiation quality N-60, 
which is obtained using 60 KeV of peak kilovoltage in the x-ray tube and filters of aluminum (4 mm) and copper (0.6 mm).
The considered operational quantity is ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), 
with a radiation incidence angle of 0ยบ at a distance of 1 m from the x-ray tube.
The tool that **USpekPy** provides to do this is the **SpekWrapper** class.

The next python script shows how to compute the first and second half-value layers for aluminium and copper, 
the mean energy, the air kerma and the mean air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficient.

```python
from src.uspekpy.wrapper import SpekWrapper

# Define x-ray beam parameters for radiation quality N-60 (filter thickness, peak kilovoltage and anode angle)
my_filters = [
    ('Al', 4),  # mm
    ('Cu', 0.6),  # mm
    ('Sn', 0),  # mm
    ('Pb', 0),  # mm
    ('Be', 0),  # mm
    ('Air', 1000)  # mm
]
my_kvp = 60  # kV
my_th = 10  # deg

# Define path to CSV file containing mass energy transfer coefficients of air in terms of the energy
my_mu_csv = 'data/mu_tr_rho.csv'

# Define path to CSV file containing the monoenergetic air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficients for H*(10)
my_hk_csv = 'data/h_k_h_amb_10.csv'

# Initialize an SpeckWrapper object and add filters
spectrum = SpekWrapper(kvp=my_kvp, th=my_th)
spectrum.multi_filter(my_filters)

# Calculate half-value layers for aluminum and copper
hvl1_al = spectrum.get_hvl1()
hvl2_al = spectrum.get_hvl2()
hvl1_cu = spectrum.get_hvl1(matl='Cu')
hvl2_cu = spectrum.get_hvl2(matl='Cu')

# Calculate mean energy
mean_energy = spectrum.get_mean_energy()

# Calculate mean air kerma
mean_kerma = spectrum.get_mean_kerma(mass_transfer_coefficients=my_mu_csv)

# Calculate mean conversion coefficient
mean_hk = spectrum.get_mean_conversion_coefficient(
    mass_transfer_coefficients=my_mu_csv, conversion_coefficients=my_hk_csv)

# Print results
print(f'First HVL for Al: {hvl1_al} mm')
print(f'Second HVL for Al: {hvl2_al} mm')
print(f'First HVL for Cu: {hvl1_cu} mm')
print(f'Second HVL for Cu: {hvl2_cu} mm')
print(f'Mean energy: {mean_energy} keV')
print(f'Air kerma: {mean_kerma} Gy')
print(f'Mean conversion coefficient for H*(10): {mean_hk} Sv/Gy')
```

The script output is:

```
First HVL for Al: 5.904510251136515 mm
Second HVL for Al: 6.239790098050192 mm
First HVL for Cu: 0.23502729534875702 mm
Second HVL for Cu: 0.2624330033450075 mm
Mean energy: 47.797974735384756 keV
Air kerma: 2.219951531747007 Gy
Mean conversion coefficient for H*(10): 1.5909359863722154 Sv/Gy
```

### Compute mean radiation protection quantities with uncertainties

This second example shows how to compute the mean values and uncertainties of some radiation protection quantities 
of an x-ray spectrum simulated using SpekPy.
The considered x-ray spectrum is the one corresponding to the radiation quality N-60, 
which is obtained using 60 KeV of peak kilovoltage in the x-ray tube and filters of aluminum (4 mm) and copper (0.6 mm).
The considered operational quantity is ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), 
with a radiation incidence angle of 0ยบ at a distance of 1 m from the x-ray tube.
The tool that **USpekPy** provides to do this is the **USpek** class.

The next python script shows how to compute the first and second half-value layers for aluminium and copper, 
the mean energy, the air kerma and the mean air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficient.

```python
from src.uspekpy.uspek import USpek

# Define values and relative uncertainty (k=1) of x-ray beam parameters for radiation quality N-60
# (filter thickness, peak kilovoltage and anode angle)
my_beam = {
    'kVp': (60, 0.01),  # mm, fraction of one
    'th': (20, 0.01),  # mm, fraction of one
    'Al': (4, 0.01),  # mm, fraction of one
    'Cu': (0.6, 0.01),  # mm, fraction of one
    'Sn': (0, 0),  # mm, fraction of one
    'Pb': (0, 0),  # mm, fraction of one
    'Be': (0, 0),  # mm, fraction of one
    'Air': (1000, 0.01)  # mm, fraction of one
}

# Define path to CSV file containing mass energy transfer coefficients of air in terms of the energy
my_mu_csv = 'data/mu_tr_rho.csv'

# Define path to CSV file containing the monoenergetic air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficients for H*(10)
my_hk_csv = 'data/h_k_h_amb_10.csv'

# Define values and relative uncertainty (k=1) of mass energy transfer coefficients of air
my_mu_std = 0.01  # fraction of one

# Initialize a USpekPy object with the defined beam parameters, mass energy transfer coefficients of air
# and monoenergetic air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficients for H*(10)
s = USpek(beam_parameters=my_beam, mass_transfer_coefficients=my_mu_csv,
          mass_transfer_coefficients_uncertainty=my_mu_std, conversion_coefficients=my_hk_csv)

# Run simulation with a given number of iterations
df = s.simulate(simulations_number=3)

# Define the path of the output file where the simulation results will be saved
my_output_csv = 'output/output.csv'

# Save results to a CSV file
df.to_csv(my_output_csv, index=True)

# Print results
print(df.to_string())

```

The script **output** is a table containing the randomly sampled values of the beam parameters and 
the computed mean radiation protection quantities of the simulated x-ray spectrum 
for each iteration of the Monte Carlo simulation.
It also contains their mean values and standard uncertainties (k=1).
The **units** are
kV for the peak kilovoltage,
deg for the anode angle,
mm for the filter thickness, air gap and half-value layers, 
keV for the mean energy,
Gy for the air kerma and 
Sv/Gy for the mean air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficient.

### Compute batch simulation for several x-ray spectra

This third example shows how to perform batch simulation to compute the mean values and uncertainties of 
radiation protection quantities for several x-ray spectra simulated with SpekPy.
The considered x-ray spectrum is the one corresponding to the radiation quality N-60, 
which is obtained using 60 KeV of peak kilovoltage in the x-ray tube and filters of aluminum (4 mm) and copper (0.6 mm).
The considered operational quantity is ambient dose equivalent, H*(10), 
with a radiation incidence angle of 0ยบ at a distance of 1 m from the x-ray tube.
The tool that **USpekPy** provides to do this is the **batch_simulation()** function.

To perform the batch simulation you need and **input file** where the parameters of each simulation are specified.
This can be a CSV file or an Excel file.
- **First column: simulation parameters' names**:
The first column contain the names of the quantities used as simulation parameters.
They are grouped in general parameters (radiation quality, operational quantity, irradiation angle and number of simulations),
value parameters (filters thickness, air gap, peak kilovoltage, anode angle, mass energy transfer coefficients of air and monoenergetic air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficients)
and relative uncertainty parameters (filters thickness, air gap, peak kilovoltage, anode angle, mass energy transfer coefficients).
Units of value parameters are specified in the column.
Relative uncertainties are fractional uncertainties, i.e., they are expressed as fractions of one.
The name of the parameters must not be changed, since they are used for data parsing.
- **Next columns: simulation parameters' values**:
The next columns contain the values of the simulation parameters, one column for each simulation case.

The next table shows the content of the input file for this example.

The next python script shows how to compute the first and second half-value layers for aluminium and copper, 
the mean energy, the air kerma and the mean air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficient 
for the previous **input file in CSV format**.

```python
from src.uspekpy.simulation import batch_simulation

# Define the path to the input CSV file
my_csv = 'data/input.csv'

# Call the batch_simulation function with the defined input CSV file
df = batch_simulation(input_file_path=my_csv)

# Define the path of the output file where the simulation results will be saved
my_output_csv = 'output/output.csv'

# Save results to a CSV file
df.to_csv(my_output_csv, index=True)

# Print results
print(df.to_string())

```

The next python script shows how to compute the first and second half-value layers for aluminium and copper, 
the mean energy, the air kerma and the mean air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficient 
for the previous **input file in Excel format**.

```python
from src.uspekpy.simulation import batch_simulation

# Define the path to the input Excel file
my_excel = 'data/input.xlsx'

# Define the name of the sheet in the input Excel file
my_sheet = 'input'

# Call the batch_simulation function with the defined input Excel file and sheet
df = batch_simulation(input_file_path=my_excel, sheet_name=my_sheet)

# Define the path of the output file where the simulation results will be saved
my_output_csv = 'output/output.csv'

# Save results to a CSV file
df.to_csv(my_output_csv, index=True)

```

In both cases, the script **output** is a table in which the simulation results for each case 
are concatenated to the input table.
Simulation results includes the computed mean values and standard uncertainties (k=1) 
for the radiation protection quantities of each simulated x-ray spectrum.
The **units** are
mm for the half-value layers, 
keV for the mean energy,
Gy for the air kerma and 
Sv/Gy for the mean air kerma-to-dose-equivalent conversion coefficient.
